- **Encrypted comms** (AES/TLS-ready)
- **Modular plugin system** (keylogger, screen, lateral, recon, etc.)
- **AI task suggestion & automation**

## 🚀 Quickstart

1. **Configure C2/keys in `config.py`**
2. **Deploy agent (`python agents/windows/win_agent.py` etc.)**
3. **Run dashboard (`python operator/dashboard/main_dashboard.py`)**
4. **Use tools: notes, mode switch, voice, etc.**

## 🧠 Next Steps

- **For real-world ops:**  
  - Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for secure remote access, tunneling, and agent deployment.
  - Example:  
    - `ngrok http 5000` (for dashboard remote access)
    - `docker run -v $(pwd):/app professor2master-agent`
- **Upgrade plugins, add new modules, and keep innovating!**
